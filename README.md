# Tutorial-Notes

## This is where I am learning Javascript and write notes on the go

#### I hope these notes help. Also, I write the notes the way I have just learned them
#### So even if there is a "more faster way" to improve the code, I just want to learn 
#### the concept as a whole, and get down the basics before i get down to the core before
#### I get more advanced.
