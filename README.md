### Tutorial-Notes

#### *Hey there! This is where I am learning Javascript and write notes on the go*

###### Just to get started...
```javascript
    console.log("Hello World");
```
#### The things I wish to get down is:
* Full Javascript syntax
* Object Oriented syntax
* Api uses
* Webapp of some kind
* Website of some kind

#### I hope these notes help. Also, I write the notes the way I have just learned them. So even if there is a "more faster way" to improve the code, I just want to learn the concept as a whole, and get down the basics before i get down to the core before I get more advanced.
